Data Analysis Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Statistics
Machine Learning: Building AI models, feature engineering, and data processing
Computer Science Fundamentals: Data Structures and Algorithms, Networks, Databases
🌱 Currently Learning
I'm constantly improving my AI and data science skills, working on interesting projects and preparing to be internship and job-ready.

💼 Open for Job Opportunities
I am currently looking for job opportunities in AI, Data Science, and Software Development. My background in engineering combined with practical project experience has given me a solid foundation in solving complex problems and implementing innovative solutions.

🔭 Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. LAN Chat Application
A simple server-client chat application that works over a local network, enabling multiple users to communicate within the same network.

Tech stack: Python, Sockets
Features: Multi-user chat functionality, real-time communication
2. Video Captioning AI
An AI model that automatically generates captions for videos using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of videos with corresponding captions to provide contextually accurate captions.

Tech stack: Python, Deep Learning, TensorFlow, NLP
Features: Generates descriptive captions for any video input
3. Sleep Detection System
A computer vision-based system that detects whether a person is sleeping using eye aspect ratio (EAR) techniques with facial landmark detection. This project includes future scope for gaze detection and a user-friendly GUI.

Tech stack: Python, OpenCV, dlib
Features: Detects sleep based on eye movement, accurate in real-time scenarios
Future Scope: GUI implementation, gaze detection, and automatic sleep summary generation
4. Course Review Website
A web application that allows students to review and rate the courses they have taken. It is designed to help future students make informed decisions.

Tech stack: Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Features: Course ratings and reviews, user authentication, responsive design
📊 Competitive Programming
I have solved over 300 DSA problems and achieved a rating of 1570+ on LeetCode. I'm constantly practicing and improving my problem-solving skills to prepare for coding interviews.
